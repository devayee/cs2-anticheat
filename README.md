cs2-anticheat is an anti-cheat system in development for CounterStrike 2. It lacks an Aimbot detector or something. I wanted to share it here because I don't have time. If anyone wants to develop it, you can contact me or send a PR.

If you would like to donate or need assistance with the plugin, feel free to contact me via Discord, either privately or on my server.

# TO DO
- [ ] Adding Aimbot-style detectors
- [ ] Anti Wallhack should be well tested. Thanks to Valve, players crash all the time. Not recommended for use at this time.
